#TODO:
  #add a check to human logic for valid inputs
  #add more game options -- difficulty.
  #remove puts statements
  #remove unnecessary comments



#Could add options for: 
  #changing the game length (difficulty), 
  #prompts or pauses between computer turns for better readability,
  #final prompts for playing again or exiting.
