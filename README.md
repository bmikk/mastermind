Welcome to Mastermind!

This is a representation of the classic game, and can be played in the console against the computer as either the code-breaker or the code-maker. 

As the code-breaker, you'll guess combinations of colors until you break the code created by the computer. But be careful! If you run out of guesses, you lose!

As the code-maker, you create a code and let the computer try to guess. But I doubt you can stump him, he's pretty smart!
